In each simulation step, 
movement of each object is calculated as following manner:
\begin{eqnarray}
  (u_x^{t+1},u_y^{t+1}) & = & 
        (v_x^{t}, v_y^{t}) + (a_x^{t}, a_y^{t})      \mbox{: accelerate}
\label{eq:u-t} \\
  (p_x^{t+1},p_y^{t+1}) & = & 
        (p_x^{t}, p_y^{t}) + (u_x^{t+1}, u_y^{t+1})  \mbox{: move}
                                        \nonumber \\
  (v_x^{t+1},v_y^{t+1}) & = & 
        \mbox{decay} \times (u_x^{t+1}, u_y^{t+1})   \mbox{: decay speed}
                                        \nonumber \\
  (a_x^{t+1},a_y^{t+1}) & = & 
        (0,0)     \mbox{: reset acceleration}
                                        \nonumber
\end{eqnarray}
where, 
$(p_x^{t},p_y^{t})$, and $(v_x^{t}, v_y^{t})$
are respectively position and velocity of the object in timestep $t$.
$\mbox{decay}$ is a decay parameter specified by
\scommand{ball\_decay} or \scommand{player\_decay}.
$(a_x^{t},a_y^{t})$ is acceleration of object,
which is derived from \param{Power} parameter in 
\scommand{dash} (in the case the object is a player) or
\scommand{kick} (in the case of a ball) commands
in the following manner:
\begin{eqnarray}
  (a_x^{t},a_y^{t}) & = & 
        \mbox{\param{Power}} \times \param{power\_rate}
          \times (\cos(\theta^t),\sin(\theta^t)) 
                                        \nonumber 
\end{eqnarray}
where $\theta^t$ is the direction of the object in timestep $t$ and
\param{power\_rate} is \scommand{dash\_power\_rate} or is calculated from
\scommand{kick\_power\_rate} for the ball.
In the case of a player, this is just the direction the player is facing.
%its direction is calculated as the following manner:
%#\begin{eqnarray}
%  \theta^t & = & 
%        \theta^t + \mbox{\param{Moment}} 
%                                        \nonumber
%\end{eqnarray}
%where \param{Moment} is a parameter of \scommand{turn} commands.
In the case of a ball,
its direction is given as the following manner:
\begin{eqnarray}
  \theta^t_{\mbox{ball}} & = & 
        \theta^t_{\mbox{kicker}} + \mbox{\param{Direction}} 
                                        \nonumber
\end{eqnarray}
where $\theta^t_{\mbox{ball}}$ and $\theta^t_{\mbox{kicker}}$ 
are directions of ball and kicking player respectively,
and $\mbox{\param{Direction}}$ is the second parameter of 
a \scommand{kick} command.

If at the end of the simulation cycle, two objects overlap, 
then the objects are moved back until they do not overlap.
Then the velocities are multiplied by $-0.1$.
Note that it is possible for the ball to go through a player as long
as the ball and the player never overlap at the end of the cycle.

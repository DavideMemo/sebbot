\label{sec:playmodes}

The change of the play mode is announced by the referee. Additionally,
there are some referee messages announcing events like a goal or a foul.  
If you have a look into the server source code, you will notice some
additional play modes that are currently not used. Both play modes and
referee messages are announced using \texttt{(referee \emph{String})},
where \emph{String} is the respective play mode or message string. The
play modes are listed in Tab.~\ref{tab:playmodes}, for the messages
see Tab.~\ref{tab:refereemessages}.
